# Data structure app

My project demonstrate using two linked generics data structures 


# Binary search tree

My generic BST can search and find element with Complexity of **Log(h)** where h is the height.
using generic key and value i can store complex data in efficient get add and delete operation.
i also added Searching with minimum and maximum value in efficient search.

# Doubly linked list

My list implement addition like a queue and handle delete items in descending Order
the time complexity of add and remove is by **O(1)** thanks to the Prev and Next pointer in each node.

# Use case the app

The app manage a boxes store storage and can add remove and give best offer for squared bottomed box represente as X and height represented as Y.
My app store the data for the boxes in the store in a doubly dimentional BST with key and value

-Main tree has Double key and BST value
-Each inner BST has Double key and Box value
