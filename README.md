# Data structure app

My project demonstrate using two linked generics data structures 


# Binary search tree

My generic BST can search and find element with Complexity of **Log(h)** where h is the height.
using generic key and value i can store complex data in efficient get add and delete operation.
i also added Searching with minimum and maximum value in efficient search.

The order of searching item with (16,10) keys with 33% percentage accuracy

# Doubly linked list

My list handle delete items in descending Order with time complexity of **O(1)** thanks.
